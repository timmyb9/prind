# Contribution Guidelines

When contributing, please:
- provide a clear and concise explanation of your pull request.
- try to make small changes, ie, make many small pull requests as opposed to a single large pull request.
- try to follow the patterns I've already established.

Contributions to `README.md` should do some or all of the following:
- add clarity
- reduce complexity for the user
- reduce verbosity
- fix errors

Thank you.
